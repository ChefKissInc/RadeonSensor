# RadeonSensor - Kext and Gadget to show Radeon GPU temperature on MacOS

![](./imgs/status_bar.png)

The kext is based on FakeSMCs RadeonMonitor to provide GPU temperature to a dedicated gadget without relying on FakeSMC being installed and can be used with VirtualSMC instead.
The design of the status bar is based on the AMD PowerGadget to fit together.
